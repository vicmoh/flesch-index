I am very proud now that we have a museum on the National Mall
where people can learn about Reverend King, so many other
things. Frederick Douglass is an example of somebody who's done
an amazing job and is being recognized more and more, I noticed.
Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and millions more black Americans who
made America what it is today. Big impact.
